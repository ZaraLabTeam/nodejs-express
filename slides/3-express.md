## ExpressJS
A lightweight platform for building web apps using NodeJS


### Features

* Router
* Handling Requests
* Application Settings
* Middleware

Middleware - Like filters that are applied on the incoming/outgoing
requests. Be ware that middleware are applied in order of their declaration

We will also add next() to indicate to our application that it should
continue to the other routes or next middleware. This is important

We can apply middleware to given routes or the entire app
